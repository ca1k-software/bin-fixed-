# Portfolio Repository
Welcome to my binary portfolio repository. This repository holds my projects and software, that I built myself. If you are interested with working with me, please contact me at ca1ksoftware@gmail.com. If you want to help me with some of my projects, feel free to contribute.
# News
I have published a Java Project; namely IronSafe. It is a password keeper. I as well have published a python calculator. Unfortunately I could not convert it into an executable.
